# AlphaGBM Earnings Crush Analysis

Quantifies the IV crush phenomenon around earnings announcements so you can decide whether to sell premium before earnings or buy after the crush.

## What This Skill Does

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| IV Crush | The sharp drop in implied volatility after an earnings announcement, regardless of stock direction |
| Average Crush % | Historical mean IV decline from pre-earnings peak to post-earnings trough |
| Implied Move | The price move the options market is pricing in via straddle pricing |
| Actual Move | The realized stock move on earnings day |
| Crush Pattern | Classification: consistent crusher, variable, or IV-resilient |
| Earnings Straddle P&L | Whether selling the at-the-money straddle before earnings has been historically profitable |

## How to Use

**Input:** A ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, NVDA, TSLA) with an earnings-related query.

**Output:**
- Crush history table (last 8 quarters): pre-earnings IV, post-earnings IV, crush %, implied move, actual move
- Average crush % and standard deviation
- Implied move vs actual move comparison (how often options overpriced the move)
- Win rate for short premium strategies around earnings
- Optimal earnings strategy recommendation (sell premium, buy post-crush, or avoid)

**Example Queries:**
- `earnings crush AAPL` — Full crush analysis for Apple
- `NVDA IV before earnings` — Pre-earnings IV levels and history
