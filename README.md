## What is AlphaGBM?

AlphaGBM is a **real-data options intelligence layer** for traders and AI agents. Every number comes from real market data -- IV, Greeks, VRP, skew, flow -- not LLM hallucination.

These 20 skills bring AlphaGBM's capabilities into your AI workflow: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any agent that supports skills.

### Why AlphaGBM?

| | LLM Roleplay Tools | Generic Finance APIs | **AlphaGBM** |
|--|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

| Verifiable | "85% confidence" | Partial | **Every number has a source** |
| Options Depth | None | Basic chain | **IV/HV/VRP/Greeks/Skew/Surface** |
| Scoring | Subjective | None | **Quantitative scoring (0-100 options, 1-10 stocks)** |
| Analysis Model | None | None | **G = B + M (Gain = Basics + Momentum)** |
| Battle-tested | No | Varies | **10K users, 3mo live trading** |
| Coverage | US only | Varies | **US + HK + CN + Commodities** |

## Quick Start

### Install as Claude Code Skills

```bash
# Clone into your project
git clone https://github.com/AlphaGBM/skills.git .claude/skills/alphagbm

```

See [cli/README.md](cli/README.md) for full CLI documentation.

### Try It (No API Key Needed)

All skills include built-in demo data for AAPL, NVDA, SPY, TSLA, and META. Just ask your AI:

> "Analyze AAPL stock using AlphaGBM"
> "Score NVDA options"
> "Show me TSLA's volatility surface"
> "What's the best bullish strategy for META?"

### Connect Live Data

```bash
# Set your API key for real-time data
export ALPHAGBM_API_KEY=agbm_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export ALPHAGBM_BASE_URL=https://alphagbm.zeabur.app  # optional, this is the default

# Get your free key at https://alphagbm.com/api-keys
```

### Check API Health

```bash
curl https://alphagbm.zeabur.app/api/health
```

Returns API status, available data fields, data source health, and market coverage — no auth needed. Useful for AI agents to verify what's available before making calls.

### How Skills Connect

Skills aren't isolated -- they reference each other to form a complete workflow:

```
Stock Analysis --> Options Score --> Options Strategy --> P&L Simulator
       |                |                    |
       v                v                    v
   Compare          Vol Surface           Greeks
                    Vol Smile
                    IV Rank --> Earnings Crush

Market Sentiment --> Unusual Activity --> Alert
                                          Watchlist

Polymarket --> Market Sentiment --> Options Strategy
```

## Data Coverage

| Market | Stocks | Options | Data Points |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| US | 200+ | Full chains | IV/HV/VRP/Greeks/Skew/Surface |
| HK | 35+ | Full chains | IV/HV/VRP/Greeks |
| CN | 20+ ETFs | Full chains | IV/HV/VRP/Greeks |
| Commodities | Au/Ag/Cu/Al | Futures options | IV/Greeks/Delivery risk |

## Real Data, Not Guesswork

Every number in AlphaGBM is **verifiable**:

| Metric | Value | How It's Computed |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| **IV** | 32.5% | Black-Scholes on actual bid/ask prices |
| **IV Rank** | 58 | Current IV vs. 252 trading days of history |
| **VRP** | +4.0% | `Implied Vol - Historical Vol` — measures option overpricing |
| **Option Score** | 80/100 | Weighted: premium yield + support/resistance + safety margin + trend + PoP + liquidity + time decay |
| **Stock Score** | 7.0/10 | `G = B + M` — Basics (PE, PEG, growth, margins) + Momentum (VIX, technicals, flow) |
| **Risk** | 4/10 | Additive: valuation +2, growth +2, liquidity +2, market +1.5, technical +1 |
| **EV** | +5.2% | `50% × 1w + 30% × 1m + 20% × 3m` expected value |

This is not *"based on my training data"* or *"I estimate with 85% confidence."*

This is math on market data.

## Example Workflow

> **You**: "Analyze AAPL, then find the best options play"

The agent chains skills automatically:

```
1. GET  /api/stock/quick-quote/AAPL          → $261.40 (-0.8%)
2. POST /api/stock/analyze-sync              → G=B+M score 7.0/10, EV +5.2%, BUY
   {"ticker": "AAPL", "style": "balanced"}     Risk 4/10, target $275, stop-loss $239

3. GET  /api/options/snapshot/AAPL           → IV 32.5%, IV Rank 58, VRP +4.0%
4. POST /api/options/chain-sync              → Sell Put scores: 80, 78, 75...
   {"symbol": "AAPL", "expiry_date": "..."}    Buy Call scores: 76, 74, 72...

5. POST /api/options/tools/strategy/build    → Bull Call Spread 265/280
   {"template_id": "bull_call_spread"}         Max profit $1085, max loss $415

6. POST /api/options/tools/simulate          → Breakeven $269.15, PoP 44.5%
   {"symbol": "AAPL", "legs": [...]}
```

> **You**: "Is that IV expensive?"

```
7. GET  /api/options/snapshot/AAPL           → IV Rank 58 (moderate)
8. GET  /api/options/tools/vol-surface/AAPL  → ATM IV in contango, earnings in 26d
```

All from real API calls. All verifiable.
